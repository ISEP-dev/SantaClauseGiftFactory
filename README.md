# Santa Claus Gift Factory - JS (Asynchronous) project
The project consists in build a gift factory. The user can selected gifts with different size (small, normal, big) and each size has different weight (1kg, 2kg, 5kg).
After we have selected a gift, the dwarf prepare it. He needs some minutes to make it. When, it's done he put it on the sled. 
The sled cannot contains more than 12 kg. In fact, the dwarf must refused the next gift if the sled is completely full. 
At the end, you can delivered the sled with the santa claus. But warn it! When the reineideers are hungry, the delivery failed.
